## Task 1: What is the first ingredient that Rick needs?

My initial step in approaching this challenge was to perform network discovery on the target machine. I used nmap to scan the IP address **10.10.105.232** for open ports and services:

The nmap scan revealed two open ports:
*	**22/tcp**: Running OpenSSH 8.2p1 (Ubuntu Linux)
*	**80/tcp**: Running Apache httpd 2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
The presence of an HTTP service on port 80 indicated a web server. To facilitate access, I added the target IP and a custom hostname (**picklerick.thm**) to my **/etc/hosts** file:

Navigating to **http://picklerick.thm/** in a web browser displayed a static page titled "Help Morty!" with a message from Rick. There were no immediate interactive elements.

To uncover more information, I inspected the page's source code **(view-source:http://picklerick.thm/)**. This revealed a hidden comment:

This username, **R1ckRul3s**, was a valuable piece of information, but its intended use was unclear at this stage. My next logical step was to perform a directory scan to uncover hidden files or directories on the web server. I used **gobuster**.

The gobuster scan identified several files and directories. The **/login.php** page presented a simple login form. I attempted to use the discovered username R1ckRul3s and brute force the password but failed.

I then examined the /robots.txt file, which contained the string **"Wubbalubbadubdub"**. Recognizing this as Rick's iconic catchphrase, I tried it as the password for the **/login.php** page, successfully gaining access.

Upon successful login, I was redirected to **/portal.php**, which featured a "Command Panel" with an input box. This suggested a command injection vulnerability. I tested it with a basic Linux command, **ls**, to list files and directories in the current working directory

The output of ls revealed a file named **Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt** that was not found during the initial gobuster scan. Navigating directly to **http://picklerick.thm/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt** in my browser revealed the first ingredient.

## Task 2: What is the second ingredient in Rick's potion?

Returning to the command panel, I continued exploring the file system. I used **ls /home** to list the contents of the **/home** directory, which revealed a user directory named **rick**

To investigate further, I ran **ls -la /home/rick** to list all files and their permissions within Rick's home directory. This command revealed a file named second ingredients.

Attempting to read the contents of second ingredients using **cat /home/rick/"second ingredients"** resulted in an error message: "Command disabled to make it hard for future PICKLEEEE RICCCKKKK." This indicated that direct cat commands were blocked.

To bypass this restriction, I decided to establish a reverse shell. I set up a Netcat listener on my attacking machine:

Next, I used the command panel to execute a BusyBox reverse shell, connecting back to my listener. (Note: The IP address changed due to a machine restart.)

Upon receiving the connection, I stabilized the reverse shell for better interactivity. From within the stabilized shell, I navigated to **/home/rick** and successfully read the second ingredients file using cat, revealing the second ingredient.

## Task 3: What is the last and final ingredient?

With a reverse shell established, the next objective was to escalate privileges and find the final ingredient. I began by checking the current user's sudo privileges using **sudo -l**

The output showed that the **www-data** user had **NOPASSWD: ALL** privileges, meaning it could execute any command as root without needing a password. This was a critical finding for privilege escalation.

After doing some searching in the file folders. I attempted to access the **/root** directory, but was initially denied due to permissions:

![Alt text](/assets/20.png)

However, leveraging the NOPASSWD sudo privilege, I could list the contents of **/root** using **sudo ls -la /root**. This revealed a file named **3rd.txt**.

Finally, I used **sudo cat /root/3rd.txt** to read the contents of the file, successfully obtaining the third and final ingredient.

## Conclusion
This challenge provided a comprehensive experience in web exploitation, including network scanning, directory enumeration, source code analysis, command injection. All three ingredients were successfully retrieved, completing Rick's potion.
